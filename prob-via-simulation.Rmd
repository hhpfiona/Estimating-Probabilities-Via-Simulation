This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a syntax for authoring documents that are a mix of text and R code and output. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. When you click the **Knit** button above, a document will be generated that includes both the text content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within your R Markdown file. 
## INTRODUCTION

The greyed-out section below is an R code chunk. Any R code you type in an R code chunk may be run in R Markdown by clicking on the 'play' (triangle) button in the top right corner of the chunk. All R code chunks will be compiled when you knit your rmd file to produce your pdf file. 

For example, we could use the following code to simulate flipping a fair coin in R:

```{r}
# Any comments you include in an R code chunk must be proceeded with "#"

# save possible outcomes in an R vector (called outcomes here)
outcomes<-c("H","T")

# flip fair coin once
set.seed(1005844909)
sample(outcomes,1)

# flip fair coin three times (need to set argument replace=TRUE to sample with replacement)
set.seed(1005844909)
sample(outcomes,3,replace=TRUE)

# could also define possible outcomes in terms of numbers - e.g., 0 for Tails and 1 for Heads
# these can be saved in an R object like above - e.g., outcomes<-0:1 or written as the first 
# argument in your sample function
set.seed(1005844909)
sample(0:1,1)
set.seed(1005844909)
sample(0:1,3, replace=TRUE)

# may wish to store results in a new R object
results<-sample(0:1,3, replace=TRUE)

# type the name of the R object to see its contents
results

# can use sum() and mean() functions on results
sum(results) # since 1 represents heads here and 0 is tails, this is the number of heads
# since 1 represents heads here and 0 is tails, 
# this is the proportion or relative frequency of heads:
mean(results)

# we could also write mean(results==1); it will give the same result here:
mean(results==1)

1.  

R code to simulate rolling *one* fair six-sided die *once*.
```{r}
set.seed(1005844909)
die<-c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
sample(x=die, size=1, replace=TRUE, prob=rep(1/6, times = 6))
```
Simulated outcome: 5


2. 

R code to simulate rolling *one* fair six-sided die *1000 times*. Results stored in `rolls`. Then, estimate the probability of rolling a *2* on one roll of a fair six-sided die based on simulated results.
```{r}
set.seed(1005844909)
die<-c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
rolls<-sample(x=die, size=1000, replace=TRUE, prob=rep(1/6, times = 6))
mean(rolls==2)
```
Estimated probability of rolling a 2: 0.163
The theoretical probability of rolling a *2* when I roll a fair
six-sided die is *1/6 = 0.1666667*. This is close to my estimated probability,
but not exactly the same. This is because the estimated probability used a sample size of 
only 1000 which is not big enough to estimate the true probability.

3. 

R code to simulate rolling this weighted six-sided die *5000 times*. The theoretical probability of rolling a *2* with this weighted die is p = *(1 - 0.4)/5 = 0.12*.

```{r}
set.seed(1005844909)
die<-c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
rolls<-sample(x=die, size=5000, replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.12, 0.12, 0.12, 0.4, 0.12, 0.12))
mean(rolls==2)
```

Estimated probability of rolling a 2: 0.1212. 
My estimated probability of rolling a 2 with this weighted die was 0.1212, which is very close but not exactly the same to the theoretical probability of 0.12. 
This is not surprising as the sample size is 5000, so I expect the estimation to be very close 
to the real probability. However, 5000 is still not infinity, so I do not expect the estimated
and the real probability to be exactly equal. 


4. 

Conditional probabilities can be estimated via simulation as well. For example, consider flipping a fair coin *3* times. Let event $A=\mbox{flip at least one head}$, and event $B=\mbox{flip exactly two heads}$, and suppose we would like to estimate $P(B|A)$. The following code simulates $1000$ repetitions of this experiment and estimates the probability of $P(B|A)$. Try running it and compare it to the theoretical value of $P(B|A)$.

```{r}
reps<-1000
num_heads<-numeric(reps)          # initializes vector to store number of heads for all reps  
for (i in 1:reps) {               # for loop simulates the experiment 'reps' times
flips<-sample(0:1,3,replace=TRUE) # temporarily store current rep in flips
num_heads[i]<-sum(flips)          # store number of heads in ith entry of vector num_heads 
}

# after the above code runs, vector num_heads contains number of heads for each repetition
P_BandA<-mean(num_heads==2&num_heads>=1)
P_A<-mean(num_heads>=1)
P_BandA/P_A

#another way that focuses on when A occurs only
nA<-0
nBinA<-0
for (i in 1:reps) {
  if (num_heads[i]>=1) {
    nA<-nA+1                              # track number of repetitions where A occurs
    if (num_heads[i]==2) nBinA<-nBinA+1   # track number of repetitions B occurs when A occurs
  }
}
nBinA/nA

```

Let's consider a *different* experiment. Consider rolling *two* fair six-sided dice and determining the sum of the dots showing on the two dice. Let event $C=\mbox{roll exactly one 1}$, and event $D=\mbox{sum of two dice is less than 6}$, and suppose we would like to estimate $P(D|C)$ based on *5000* repetitions of the experiment. 

```{r}
set.seed(1005844909)
reps<-5000
die_1<-numeric(reps)
die_2<-numeric(reps)

for (i in 1:reps) {               
first<-sample(1:6,1,replace=TRUE)
second<-sample(1:6,1,replace=TRUE) 
die_1[i]<-first
die_2[i]<-second
}

nC<-0
nDinC<-0
for (i in 1:reps) {
  if (die_1[i]==1&die_2[i]!=1|die_1[i]!=1&die_2[i]==1) {
    nC<-nC+1
    if (sum(die_1[i], die_2[i])<6) nDinC<-nDinC+1
  }
}
nDinC/nC
```
Estimate of $P(D|C)$: 0.6030043. 

There are a total of 6*6 = 36 different scenarios when rolling two die. 

We get exactly one 1 when either the first die is 1, and the second die is between 2 and 6, 
or the first die is between 2 and 6, and the second die is 1. This adds up to a total of 
10 scenarios. So p(C) = 10/36.

To get a sum of less than 6, we can values 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 2-1, 2-2, 2-3, 3-1, 3-2, 4-1,
which are a total of 10 scenarios. So p(D) = 10/36.

Considering both scenarios, we see that C and D occur both when the die values are 
1-3, 1-4, 1-5, 3-1, 4-1, 5-1, which gives $p(D \cap C) = 6/36$.

$P(D|C) = \frac{P(D \cap C)}{P(C)} = \frac{6/36}{10/36} = 6/10 = 0.6$.

This value is very close to my estimated value, which is expected given the sample size was 5000.



5. 

Consider the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

We use R to compute the number of possible rearrangements of these *6 digits*. Then, we use R code to simulate one repetition of this experiment. 


```{r}
# 5ai. count
factorial(6)
# 5aii. simulate
set.seed(1005844909)
sample(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6))
```

We use R to compute the number of ways *3 digits* can be randomly selected from the *6 digits* one at a time without replacement. Then, we use R code to simulate one repetition of this experiment. ```{r}
# 5bi. count
choose(6, 3)
# 5bii. simulate
set.seed(1005844909)
sample(6, 3, replace=FALSE)
```

We use R to compute the number of ways sets of *2 digits* can be selected at random from the *6 digits*. Then, we use R code to simulate one repetition of this experiment. 

```{r}
# 5ci. count
choose(6, 2)

# 5cii. simulate
set.seed(1005844909)
sample(6, 2, replace=TRUE)
```
